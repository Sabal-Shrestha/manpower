                  Project-based employment is followed when a company wants to
                  hire people on a temporary basis to work on specific projects
                  or tasks. The employee's engagement is for a fixed time frame
                  specified at the time they were hired, and project-based
                  workers' pay is generally based on project completion rather
                  than the number of hours worked. Many industries use
                  contingent skilled manpower through project employment, and
                  this is increasingly seen as the way forward, allowing workers
                  and businesses to become more responsive to an increasingly
                  dynamic marketplace.
                </p>
                <p>
                  Employees hired for a specific project quite often have skills
                  that the company does not require all of the time. Project
                  workers are typically paid as per the project and are paid
                  upon completion of the project. These specifics will be
                  specified at the time of the engagement so that both parties
                  are fully aware of their respective positions. The nature of
                  project-based hiring can make contingent skilled manpower a
                  cost-effective option for businesses while also benefiting the
                  employees. The project-based workforce is more adaptable, with
                  hours determined or determinable by both parties at the outset
                  of the engagement, and businesses know where they stand in
                  terms of costs. Furthermore, unlike company employees,
                  contractors are responsible for their own taxes, which can
                  result in lower company costs.
